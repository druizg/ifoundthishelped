My name is Rob. I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur and 7 years ago I totally destroyed my body by cycling way too much. Since then I've done some things very well and others very badly.

A while back I wrote <a href-"http://robertheaton.com/2013/03/19/how-chronic-pain-has-made-me-happier/" target="_blank">this</a> that was republished <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5991778/how-chronic-pain-has-made-me-happier" target="_blank">here</a>. A lot of people contacted me saying how much they related to what I wrote (some people also contacted me saying they didn't), and I spoke to people all over the world about how they were dealing with chronic pain and what I had found helped. It turns out there are a lot of other things I have found very helpful over the years, and that's why "I found this helped" exists.

I'd love to hear from you about your experiences. You can get me on <a href="mailto:bobjheaton@gmail.com">bobjheaton@gmail.com</a>.

I am <a href="http://twitter.com/RobJHEaton" target="_blank">@RobJHeaton</a> on Twitter, and I write about whatever comes into my head at <a href="http://robertheaton.com" target="_blank">robertheaton.com</a>.
